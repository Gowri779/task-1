Overview of the Project
This task involves developing a Decision Tree model using Scikit-Learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. The primary goal is to classify or predict outcomes based on patterns found in a chosen dataset. The process includes several key steps, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

Key Steps Involved:
Dataset Selection & Preprocessing

Choose an appropriate dataset (e.g., Titanic survival, Iris dataset, or a custom dataset).
Load the dataset using pandas and explore its structure.
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize/scale numerical features.
Splitting Data for Training & Testing

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance
